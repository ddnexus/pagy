# Javascript Navs

The following `pagy*_nav_js` helpers:

- `pagy_nav_js`
- `pagy_bootstrap_nav_js`
- `pagy_bulma_nav_js`
- `pagy_foundation_nav_js`
- `pagy_materialize_nav_js`
- `pagy_semantic_nav_js`

look like a normal `pagy*_nav` but have a few added features:

1. Client-side rendering
2. Optional responsiveness
3. Better performance and resource usage (see [Maximizing Performance](/docs/how-to.md#maximize-performance))

Here is a screenshot (from the `bootstrap`extra) showing responsiveness at different widths:

## Synopsis

See [Setup Javascript](setup.md).

||| pagy.rb (initializer)
```ruby
# Use just one:
require 'pagy/extras/bootstrap'
require 'pagy/extras/bulma'
require 'pagy/extras/foundation'
require 'pagy/extras/materialize'
require 'pagy/extras/navs'
require 'pagy/extras/semantic'
require 'pagy/extras/uikit'
```
|||

||| Any View

```erb
<!-- Use just one: -->
<%== pagy_nav_js(@pagy) %>
<%== pagy_bootstrap_nav_js(@pagy) %>
<%== pagy_bulma_nav_js(@pagy) %>
<%== pagy_foundation_nav_js(@pagy) %>
<%== pagy_materialize_nav_js(@pagy) %>
<%== pagy_semantic_nav_js(@pagy) %>

## Variables

| Variable | Description                                                        | Default |
|:---------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------|
| `:steps` | Hash variable to control multiple pagy `:size` at different widths | `false` |

=== How to use the :steps variable

The `:steps` is an optional non-core variable used by the `pagy*_nav_js` navs. If it's `false`, the `pagy*_nav_js` will behave exactly as a static `pagy*_nav` respecting the single `:size` variable, just faster and lighter. If it's defined as a hash, it allows you to control multiple pagy `:size` at different widths.

You can set the `:steps` as a hash where the keys are integers representing the widths in pixels and the values are the Pagy `:size` variables to be applied for that width.

As usual, depending on the scope of the customization, you can set the variables globally or for a single pagy instance, or even pass it to the `pagy*_nav_js` helper as an optional keyword argument.

For example:

||| pagy.rb (initializer)
```ruby
# globally
Pagy::DEFAULT[:steps] = { 0 => [2,3,3,2], 540 => [3,5,5,3], 720 => [5,7,7,5] }
```
|||

||| Controller
```ruby
# or for a single instance
pagy, records = pagy(collection, steps: { 0 => [2,3,3,2], 540 => [3,5,5,3], 720 => [5,7,7,5] } )

# or use the :size as any static pagy*_nav
pagy, records = pagy(collection, steps: false )
```
|||

```erb
or pass it to the helper
<%== pagy_nav_js(@pagy, steps: {...}) %>
```

The above statement means that from `0` to `540` pixels width, Pagy will use the `[2,3,3,2]` size, from `540` to `720` it will use the `[3,5,5,3]` size and over `720` it will use the `[5,7,7,5]` size. (Read more about the `:size` variable in the [How to control the page links](/docs/how-to.md#control-the-page-links) section).

!!!primary :steps must contain `0` width
You can set any number of steps with any arbitrary width/size. The only requirement is that the `:steps` hash must contain always the `0` width or a `Pagy::VariableError` exception will be raised.
!!!

#### Setting the right sizes

Setting the widths and sizes can create a nice transition between widths or some apparently erratic behavior.

Here is what you should consider/ensure:

1. The pagy size changes in discrete `:steps`, defined by the width/size pairs.

2. The automatic transition from one size to another depends on the width available to the pagy nav. That width is the _internal available width_ of its container (excluding eventual horizontal padding).

3. You should ensure that - for each step - each pagy `:size` produces a nav that can be contained in its width.

4. You should ensure that the minimum internal width for the container div be equal (or a bit bigger) to the smaller positive width. (`540` pixels in our previous example).

5. If the container width snaps to specific widths in discrete steps, you should sync the quantity and widths of the pagy `:steps` to the quantity and internal widths for each discrete step of the container.

===

!!!warning Window Resizing
The `pagy_*nav_js` elements are automatically re-rendered on window resize. However, if the container width changes *without* being triggered by a window resize, you need to explicitly re-render:

```js
document.getElementById('my-pagy-nav-js').render();
```

## Methods

==- `pagy*_nav_js(pagy, ...)`

The method accepts also a few optional keyword arguments:

- `:pagy_id` which adds the `id` HTML attribute to the `nav` tag
- `:link_extra` which add a verbatim string to the `a` tag (e.g. `'data-remote="true"'`)
- `:steps` variable

!!!warning
The `pagy_bootstrap_nav_js` and `pagy_semantic_nav_js` assign a class attribute to their links, so do not add another class attribute with the `:link_extra`. That would be illegal HTML and ignored by most browsers.
