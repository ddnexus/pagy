# TO DO
        
- [x] Remove all Jekyll related files
- [x] Remove all `docs-site` related configuration
- [] Replace the old Jekyll based docs in `docker/README.md` with the `retype` based docs.
- [x] Change the icons folders for `api` and `extras` to icons that consistent with having a content, not being just a container.
- [x] Try a small non-invasive icon for the elements in `api` and in `extras` (not sure it will improve). Better if the icons are related to the categories
- [x] Add icons to all the entries in the left bar
- [x] Add categories to each page in `api` and `extras` dirs
- [x] Add the `image: none` to all the categorized pages
- [] Add proper descriptions for each page that has categories
- [] Refactor the description of `Pagy::Backend` 
- [] Refactor the description of `Pagy::I18n` (translation + localization) 
- [] Refactor of `index.md`
  - [x] It should be Home and use the classic icon
  - [] Basic concepts should be a sub topic
- [] Refactoring of How To
  - [x] Extract Quick Start from How to
    - [x] Replace the links in other documents
  - [x] Extract the Configuration section
    - [x] Replace the links in other document
    - [x] Link the `config/pagy.js` as a download link
