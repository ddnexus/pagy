### Special cases

- If the collection to paginate is not a collection supported out of the box like ActiveRecord scope, [array](extras/array.md), [elasticsearch_rails](extras/elasticsearch_rails.md), [searchkick](extras/searchkick.md), [meilisearch](extras/meilisearch.md), ... you may need to override the `pagy_*get_vars` backend method.
- If the collection you are paginating doesn't respond to `offset` and `limit` and is not yet supported by any extra, you may need to override the `pagy_get_items` method in your controller (to get the items out of your specific collection)
- If your framework doesn't have a `params` method you can use the [standalone extra](extras/standalone.md) or you may need to define the `params` method or override the `pagy_get_vars` (which uses the `params` method) in your controller
- If your framework doesn't have a `request` method you can use the [standalone extra](extras/standalone.md) or you may need to override the `pagy_url_for` (which uses `Rack` and `request`) in your view

!!!
The total overriding you may need is usually just a handful of lines at worse, and it doesn't need monkey patching or writing any sub-class or module
