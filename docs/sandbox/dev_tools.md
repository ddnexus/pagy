Pagy offers a couple of tools to ease your development process.

You can activate them by adding this line in the `head` of your layout/page:

```ruby
<%== Pagy.dev_tools %>
```

[!button corners="pill" variant="success" text=":icon-play: Try it now!"](../sandbox/playground#demo-app)

#### Pagy Wand

Integrate pagy with your app's themes interactively.

- Control most of the visual aspects of pagy with a few presets and sliders. 
- Copy/paste the generated "CSS Override" block in your stylesheet to persist it in your app.
- Click on the :icon-question: icon on the Wand for help.
