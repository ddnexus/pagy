# Arel Extra

This extra adds a specialized pagination for collections from sql databases with `GROUP BY` clauses, by computing the total number of results with `COUNT(*) OVER ()`.

!!! warning
Tested against MySQL (8.0.17) and Postgres (11.5).
Before using in a different database, make sure the sql `COUNT(*) OVER ()` performs a count of all the lines after the `GROUP BY` clause is applied.
!!!

## Methods


==- `pagy_arel(collection, vars=nil)`

This method is the same as the generic `pagy` method, but with improved speed for SQL `GROUP BY` collections. (see the [pagy doc](/docs/api/backend.md#pagycollection-varsnil))

==- `pagy_arel_get_vars(collection)`

This sub-method is the same as the `pagy_get_vars` sub-method, but it is called only by the `pagy_arel` method. (see the [pagy_get_vars doc](/docs/api/backend.md#pagy_get_varscollection-vars)).

==- `pagy_arel_count(collection)`

This sub-method it is called only by the `pagy_get_vars` method. It will detect which query to perform based on the active record groups (sql `GROUP BY`s). In case there aren't group values performs a normal `.count(:all)`, otherwise it will perform a `COUNT(*) OVER ()`. The last tells database to perform a count of all the lines after the `GROUP BY` clause is applied.
