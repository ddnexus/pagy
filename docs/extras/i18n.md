# I18n Extra

Use the `i18n` standard gem for the translations of the pagy strings.

It delegates translations and [localization of the calendar time labels](calendar.md#i18n-localization) to the `i18n` gem (which should obviously be installed).

A change in the global `I18n.locale` will automatically translate and localize all Pagy output accordingly.

!!!warning Prefer Pagy i18n
You should have some very good reasons to use the `i18n` gem instead of the pagy implementation, because the `i18n` gem is ~18x slower and uses ~10x more memory than the [Pagy::I18n](/docs/api/i18n) default implementation.

Having the `i18n` gem already installed and configured in your app might not count as a good reason, because, besides being faster and lighter, the [Pagy::I18n](/docs/api/i18n) is super easy to configure and doesn't require any change in the `i18n` of the rest of your app.
