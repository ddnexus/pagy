# Standalone Extra

This extra allows you to use pagy completely standalone, i.e. without any request object, nor Rack environment/gem, nor any defined `params` method, even in the irb/rails console without an app (see the [Pagy::Console](/docs/api/console.md) module).

You may need it in order to paginate a collection outside of a regular rack request or controller, like in an unconventional API module, or in the irb/rails console or for testing/playing with backend and frontend methods.

You trigger the standalone mode by setting an `:url` variable, which will be used directly and verbatim, instead of extracting it from the `request` `Rack::Request` object. You can also pass other params by using the `:params` variable as usual. That will be used to produce the final URLs in the usual way.

This extra will also create a dummy `params` method (if not already defined) in the module where you will include the `Pagy::Backend` (usually a controller).

## Synopsis

||| pagy.rb (initializer)
```ruby
require 'pagy/extras/standalone'

# optional: set a default url
Pagy::DEFAULT[:url] = 'http://www.example.com/subdir'
```
|||

||| Controller
```ruby
# pass a :url variable to work in standalone mode (no need of any request object nor Rack env)
@pagy, @records = pagy(Product.all, url: 'http://www.example.com/subdir', params: {...})
```
|||

## Variables

| Variable | Description                              | Default |
|:---------|:-----------------------------------------|:--------|
| `:url`   | url string (can be absolute or relative) | `nil`   |

You can use the `:params` variable to add params to the final URLs.

## Methods

### Overridden pagy_url_for

The `standalone` extra overrides the `pagy_url_for` method used internally. If it finds a set `:url` variable it assumes there is no `request` object, so it uses the `:url` variable verbatim to produce the final URL, only adding the query string, composed by merging the `:page` param to the `:params` variable. If there is no `:url` variable set it works like usual, i.e. it uses the rake `request` object to extract the base_url, path from the request, merging the params returned from the `params` controller method, the `:params` variable and the `:page` param to it.

### Dummy params method

This extra creates a dummy `params` method (if not already defined) in the module where you include the `Pagy::Backend` (usually a controller). The method is called by pagy to retrieve backend variables coming from the request, and expects a hash, so the dummy param method returns an empty hash avoiding an error.
