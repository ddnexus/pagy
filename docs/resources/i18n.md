## Internationalization

---

Pagy handles string translation and pluralization using its own efficient i18n implementation.

!!!primary

`Pagy::I18n.translate` is approximately 18 times faster and consumes about 10 times less memory compared to the standard `I18n.translate` provided by the `i18n`
gem!
!!!

### Dictionaries/locales

All Pagy strings are stored in dictionary files within its [locales](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/blob/master/gem/locales).
These files adopt the same structure as the standard locale files for the `i18n` gem, allowing you to use them seamlessly with both
systems.

### Configuring the request locale in multilingual applications

The default `Pagy::I18n.locale` is `'en'`.

For applications with multiple locales, you must set the `Pagy::I18n.locale` for each request. For instance, in a Rails application, you can implement this as follows:


```ruby Controller
before_action { Pagy::I18n.locale = params[:locale] }
```

### Customizing dictionaries

Simply place your customized dictionary files in a directory and add its path to the I18n pathnames. Uncomment or modify the relevant line in the [pagy.rb initializer](../toolbox/initializer.md).

```ruby
# Example for Rails:
Pagy::I18n.pathnames << Rails.root.join('config/locales')
```

### Using the I18n gem instead of Pagy's i18n

!!!warning Prefer Pagy::I18n

Pagy::I18n functions seamlessly _independently_ of the `i18n` gem, offering significantly better performance.
!!!

If you absolutely need to use the `i18n` gem for translating Pagy, you can simply uncomment the following line in your [pagy.js initializer](../toolbox/initializer.md):

```ruby
Pagy.translate_with_the_slower_i18n_gem!
```

Once enabled, you will no longer need to configure `Pagy::I18n.locale`, as the global `I18n.locale` will automatically handle it.

## Contributing a language

If you want to contribute a new locale to
Pagy ([see existing locales in the lib/locales directory](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/tree/master/gem/locales)), please refer to
the [locales README instructions here](../locales.md).
