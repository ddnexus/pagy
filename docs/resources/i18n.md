Pagy translates and pluralizes its strings using its own i18n implementation.

!!!primary

`Pagy::I18n.translate` is ~18x faster and uses ~10x less memory than the standard `I18n.translate` implemented by the `i18n`
gem!
!!!

### Dictionaries/locales

All the pagy strings are stored in the dictionary files of its [locales](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/blob/master/gem/locales).
The files follow the same structure of the standard locale files for the `i18n` gem, so you can use them unchanged with both
systems.

### Setting the request locale in multi-language apps

The default `Pagy::I18n.locale` is `'en'`.

If your app uses multiple locales, it must set the `Pagy::I18n.locale` at each request. For example, in a rails app you should do
something like:

```ruby Controller
before_action { Pagy::I18n.locale = params[:locale] }
```

### Customizing dictionaries

Just drop your customized dictionary/dictionaries in a dir and add its pathname to the I18n pathnames. Uncomment/edit the line in the [pagy.rb initializer](../toolbox/initializer.md).

### Using the I18n gem, instead of pagy i18n

!!!warning Prefer Pagy::I18n

Pagy::I18n works out of the box _independently_ of the `i18n` gem, and it's a lot faster.
!!!

If you really need to use the `i18n` gem for translating pagy, you can just uncomment the following line in your [pagy.js initializer](../toolbox/initializer.md)

```ruby
Pagy.translate_with_the_slower_i18n_gem!
```

After that you won't need to set the `Pagy::I18n.locale` anymore, because the global `I18n.locale` will automatically take over.

## Contribute a language

If you wish to add a new locale to
pagy ([see existing locales in the lib/locales directory](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/tree/master/gem/locales)) please follow
the [locales  readme instructions here.](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/blob/master/gem/locales/README.md).
