# Code Issue
- [ ] I researched through the [documentation](https://ddnexus.github.io/pagy/), the [pagy issues](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/issues) and a known Search Engine, and there is no reference/report/post that solves this problem
- [ ] I did install/upgraded to the latest version of pagy (or the latest `3.*` for pagy legacy)
- [ ] I am providing at least one of the following working and self-contained code support that can reproduce this issue:
   <!-- Check all that apply [x] -->
   - [ ] plain ruby file that can run as `ruby my-problem.rb`
   - [ ] edited copy of the single file [pagy_standalone_app.ru](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/blob/master/apps/pagy_standalone_app.ru)
   - [ ] link of my own branch forked from pagy, which contains an added test file  
   - [ ] link of my own branch forked from one branch of the [pagy-rails app](https://github.com/benkoshy/pagy-rails)
   - [ ] link of a standalone `docker image` downloadable from a docker repository (e.g. dockerhub.com)
   - [ ] `docker-compose` file that can be run with `docker-compose up` (and doesn't need to be built because it uses only docker images and no local context)

<!-- IMPORTANT: repositories of your own apps are not an acceptable support unless satisfy one of the points above. -->
