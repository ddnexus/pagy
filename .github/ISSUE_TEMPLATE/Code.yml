        ### ⚡ IMPORTANT!
        
        **The issue MUST provide a VALID code file confirming the bug AND complying with the list below
        OR it will be automatically closed!**
        
        #### 👍 VALID code files 
        
          - Edited copy of a single-file APP from the [Pagy Playground](https://ddnexus.github.io/pagy/playground) 
          - Link to a pagy fork containing an added test file
          - A plain ruby file that can run as a single command like `ruby my_issue.rb`
          _(without any other setup step, installation or guessing, and with no or minimal interaction required)_
        
        #### 🚫 INVALID "code" 
        
        **Please, understand that we won't guess your issue out of some snippet or description, 
        and we won't install/setup/debug your partial or complete application.**
        
        
        🚩 Avoid posting USELESS THINGS like:
        
          - Code snippets / Log transcripts
          - Descriptions of errors / behaviors / expectations
          - Rationalizations about WHY you THINK your problem is a pagy bug 
          - Multiple files / Setup instructions / Your partial or complete applications
          - and EVERYTHING other than the VALID code files listed above
        
        Instead, start from a [pagy APP](https://ddnexus.github.io/pagy/playground/#pagy-apps),
        add the smallest amount of code that exposes the bug and post it.
        It's a very quick and simple process and, most of the times, it will make your issue just "disappear". ;)
        
        _If anything is unclear to you, please ask for [support](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/discussions/categories/q-a).
        We will be happy to help._
