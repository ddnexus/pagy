        ### IMPORTANT!
        
        **The issue MUST provide a VALID code file confirming the bug AND complying with the list below
        OR it will be automatically closed!**
        
        
        #### VALID code files 
        
        
        - Edited copy of a single-file APP from the [Pagy Playground](https://ddnexus.github.io/pagy/playground) 
        
        - Link to a pagy fork containing an added test file
        
        - A plain ruby file that can run as a single command like `ruby my_issue.rb`
        _(without any other setup step, installation or guessing, and with no or minimal interaction required)_
        
        
        #### INVALID "code" 
        
        
        - Useless things like (but not limited to):
          - Code snippets / Log transcripts
          - Descriptions of errors / behaviors / expectations
          - Rationalizations about WHY and WHAT you THINK it's a bug
          - Multiple files / Setup instructions / Your partial or complete applications
          - EVERYTHING other than the VALID code files we accept
        
        
        Please, understand that we won't guess your environment/usage/configuration/conflicts out of some snippet
        or description, nor clone/install/setup/debug your parial or complete application.
        
        
        Please, start from a [pagy APP](https://ddnexus.github.io/pagy/playground/#pagy-apps)
        and add just the minimum that makes it fail. It's a very simple process and, most of the times,
        it will make your issue just "disappear". ;)
        
        
        _If anything is unclear to you, please ask for [support](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/discussions/categories/q-a).
        We will be happy to help._
