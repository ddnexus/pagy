## Which Branch?

<!---

PR, explaining that all PR should be against the master-pre branch, UNLESS they explicitly fix a specific problem of the (almost legacy) master. Ideally, if possible and portable between old and new, we would need 2 PRs for both branches, if that applies.

There are two "versions" of pagy: 

1. the "legacy" version on `master` branch and
2. the pagy 43 version on the `master-pre` branch.


- All PRs should be made against the `master-pre` branch.
- ... unless the PR fixes an issue with the (legacy) `master` branch. If that's the case, then please see if you can make two PRs (on both the `master` and `master-pre` branches) - with portable changes between the two branches.
