# Pagy Contributions

Pull Requests are welcome!

Before spending time creating a (potentially complex) Pull Request, you can [Confirm Feature Request](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/discussions/categories/feature-requests) to ensure that your proposed changes are going to be useful for most users.

If you Create A Pull Request, please ensure that the "All checks have passed" indicator gets green light on the Pull Request page (if it's not enabled, a maintainer will enable it for you).

For adding translations of locale dictionary files please follow
the [locales  readme instructions here.](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/blob/master/lib/locales/README.md).

Thank you!
