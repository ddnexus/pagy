# Pagy locales

### Please, submit your translation!

If you are using pagy with some language missing from the dictionary files, please, submit your translation!

The `pagy.info.single_page`, `pagy.info.item_name` and `pagy.items` keys of the yaml file are pluralized according to the plural rules of the language.

If you are going to submit a dictionary, please check wether the pluralization type of your language exists in the [lib/locales/utils/p11n.rb](utils/p11n.rb) file. If it is missing, please, report it. Thanks.
