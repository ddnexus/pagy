# Pagy on Docker

This dir contains a few files to setup a ruby development environment without installing anything on your system.

You can use it to develop changes, run tests and check a live preview of the documentation.

It also includes the docker files to setup a javascript testing environment using `cypress`. See the [JS Test Environment](#js-test-environment) below

## Ruby Dev Environment

The pagy docker environment has been designed to be useful for developing:

- It provides the infrastructure required (right version of ruby, jekyll server, env variables, tests, etc.) without the hassle to install and maintain anything in your system
- The local `pagy` dir is mounted at the container dir `/opt/project` so you can edit the files in your local pagy dir or in the container: they are the same files.
- The gems are installed in the container `BUNDLE_PATH=/usr/local/bundle` and that dir is `chown`ed to your user, and mounted as the docker volume `pagy_bundle`. You can use the `bundle` command and it will be persisted in the volume, no need to rebuild the image nor pollute your own system.
- Your container user `HOME` is preserved in the `pagy_user_home` volume, so you can even get back to the shell history in future sessions.

### Prerequisites

- recent `docker`
- recent `docker-compose`
- basic knowledge of docker/docker-compose

### Build

You have a couple of alternative:

1. (recommended) Permanently set a few variables about your user in your IDE or system (it will be easier for the future):

  - the `GROUP` name (get it with `id -gn` in the terminal)
  - the `UID` (get it with `id -u` in the terminal)
  - the `GID` (get it with `id -g` in the terminal)

  (Notice: you can also specify a few other variables used in the `docker-compose.yml` file.)

  ```sh
  cd pagy-on-docker
  docker-compose build pagy pagy-jekyll
  ```

2. Just set them with the command (you will have to set them each time you will have to build or do other stuff) For example:

```sh
cd pagy-on-docker
GROUP=$(id -gn) UID=$(id -u) GID=$(id -g) docker-compose build pagy pagy-jekyll
```

You need to run this only once usually, when you build the images. After that you just run the containers (see below).

### Run

Run the containers from the `pagy-on-docker` dir:

```sh
docker-compose up pagy pagy-jekyll
```

Notice, you can omit the `pagy-jekyll` if you don't need to deal with the documentation site.

Open a terminal in the pagy container and run the usual `bundle install` to install the gems into the `pagy_bundle` volume.

Then you can run `irb -I lib -r pagy` from the container in order to have `pagy` loaded and ready to try.

Run all the tests by simply running `rake` without arguments: it will run the `test`, `rubocop`, `coverge_summary` and `manifest:check` tasks.

Notice: Certain tests must run in an isolated ruby process. For example, certain extras override the core pagy methods and we need to test how pagy works with or without the extra, or with many extras at the same time. You can get the full list of of all the test tasks (and test files that each task run) with `rake -D test_*`

Check the details (not only the summary) of the coverage by running in the container:

```sh
COVERAGE_REPORT=true rake
```

Then check it at `http://0.0.0.0:63342/pagy/coverage`.

The `pagy-jekyll` service runs the jekyll server so you can edit the docs files from the local `pagy` dir and have a real-time preview of your changes at `http://localhost:4000`. You don't even need to reload the page in the browser to see the change you do in the `*.md` page file.

If you are serious about developing, you can integrate this environment with some good IDE that provides docker and ruby integration. I currently use it for all the basic pagy development, fully integrated with [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/?from=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fddnexus%2Fpagy).

### Clean up

When you want to get rid of everything related to the `pagy` development on your system:

- `rm -rf /path/to/pagy`
- `docker rmi pagy pagy-gh-pages` or `docker rmi pagy:4 pagy-gh-pages` if you don't want to remove other versions (e.g. `pagy:3`)
- `docker volume rm pagy_bundle pagy_user_home pagy_docs_site`
- `docker system prune` (not pagy related but good for reclaiming storage space from docker)

### Caveats

- If you use different pagy images for different pagy versions/branches:
    - Remember to checkout the right branch before using it
    - If you get some problem running the tests you might need to `rm -rf coverage`

## JS Test Environment

Pagy provides quite a few helpers that render the pagination elements for different js-frameworks on the client side, with improved performance. They are tested with a sinatra/rackup/puma ruby app and  [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

If you determine that you need to run the JS tests, you can choose different ways to run them:


1. Remotely in Github Actions CI:
    - Just create a PR and all the tests (including the cypress tests) will run on GitHub. Use this option if you don't need to write any js code or tests interactively and the ruby tests pass.
2. Locally on your system:
    - With a cypress desktop app that you can [download](https://download.cypress.io/desktop) and manually run from your system. The doc is available on the cypress site and it requires some basic knowledge of cypress to run the tests.
    - Or with a full cypress install with all its dependencies that you may or may not have already (e.g. node modules). The doc is available on the cypress site and it requires some basic knowledge of cypress to run the tests.
3. Inside docker:
    - With fully automated testing running the JS tests in headless mode. It requires building only one container and requires no other knowledge about cypress
    - Or opening a cypress desktop session from inside the container. It requires a bit of docker setup, but it is a complete installation that avoid polluting your system.

### Build Pagy Cypress

Check your user id with:

```sh
id -u
```

If it is `1000` you are all setup for building the container. If it is any other id, you should first open the `pagy-on-docker/docker-compose.yml` file and switch (i.e. Commenting/uncommenting) the `pagy-cypress.build.dockerimage` entries so they will look like this:

```yml
...
    # switch between the following 2 lines if your user id is 1000 or not
    # dockerfile: pagy-cypress-uid1000.dockerfile
    dockerfile: pagy-cypress.dockerfile
...
```

After saving the file, the rest of the building will be almost identical to the [Build](#build) section above.

The ony difference is that you must replace the command `docker-compose build pagy pagy-jekyll` with `docker-compose build pagy-cyress`.

All the rest (including ENV variables) is exactly the same.

### Run the tests

If you just want to run the tests, run the container from the `pagy-on-docker` dir:

```sh
docker-compose up pagy-cypress
```

That will run all the tests in headless mode and print a report right on the screen. It will also create a video for each test file run in the `test_js/cypress/videos`. That will be useful in case of failure, showing you exactly what was on the page of the browser during the whole process.

### Open Cypress

If you want to open the cypress desktop app as it was installed in your local system, and you are lucky enough to run with user id 1000 on an ubuntu system, you can just run it with the command below.

If not, (i.e. different uid or different OS or version)
you should read the comments in the `pagy-on-docker/open-cypress.yml` file, customizing it a bit according to your OS need.

Then run it with:

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f open-cypress.yml up pagy-cypress
```

That will open the cypress desktop app and will allow you to interact with it.

You can always run only the tests (without opening cypress desktop_ by running the usual:

```sh
docker-compose up pagy-cypress
```
