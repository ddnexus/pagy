# Integration test cypress IDE

# Use this file in addition to the docker-compose.yml file to override
# the pagy-cypress entrypoint so it will not run the tests automatically
# adding the configuration to open the cypress UI from the container
# like it was installed on the host

# IMPORTANT: you may have to edit the volume mounts in order to match your host OS

# USAGE
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f open-cypress.yml up pagy-cypress

version: "3.8"

      # you may need to change all these mounts by reading at the error messages in the container
      # you might also need some of the following:
      # - $XAUTHORITY:/root/.Xauthority:rw

      # or on macOS:
      # - /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix
