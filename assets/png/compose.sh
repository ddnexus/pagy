# Background / Objective: to quickly and easily capture screenshot images of pagination links
# with their respective "masks". This allows us to dispaly the images with transparency
# to make it look good on whatever background we desire in the Pagy docs.
# We found that doing things manually was extremely time consuming and error prone.

# 1. PREPARATION
#   * Install the Chrome extension FusionBase Pro
#     https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fusebase-pro-capture-scre/fddbloohgcjopkmnjdeodjcfbgiimpcn
#   * Use the "Capture Fragment" feature to capture the `.pagy` nav/div,
#     save the screenshots/masks and name each file with the file name indicated in the demo.app
#   * Open the the gem/apps/demo.ru app

# 2. SCREENSHOTS
#   * Comment the `APP_MODE = :demo` line and uncomment the `APP_MODE = :screenshot`
#     in the gem/apps/demo.ru and run `pagy demo`. WARNING: if you have installed pagy
#     as a gem, it is important that you run the correct version of your demo app, and
#     not an outdated version. To be absolutely sure you are running the latest version
#     Run the Pagy executable directly from the pagy repository: i.e.:
#             ./gem/bin/pagy demo
#   * Save the png files in the assets/png/screenshots dir
#   * Slots: please, capture the 3 slots size for bootstrap and bulma as well (e.g.:
#                   series_nav_js-7-bootstrap, series_nav_js-9-bootstrap, series_nav_js-11-bootstrap,
#                   series_nav_js-7-bulma, series_nav_js-9-bulma, series_nav_js-11-bulma
#     )s indicated in their pages

# 3. SCREENSHOT MASKS
#   * Comment the `APP_MODE = :screenshot` line and uncomment the `APP_MODE = :mask`
#     in the gem/apps/demo.ru and reboot `pagy demo`
#   * Save the png files in the assets/png/masks dir

# 4. REVERT
#   * Comment the `APP_MODE = :mask` line and uncomment the `APP_MODE = :demo`

# 5. COMPOSE THE FINAL IMAGES
#   * Run this script from its dir: ./compose.sh
