In reality the cutoffs have the same value as before, so they maintained their relative position in the set, and now there is a different number of records falling into the same pages, which is totally consistent with the changes, but possibly unespected if you have the mindset of OFFSET pagination, where the pages are split by number of records (absolute position) and not by their position relative to the records in the set.","The main goal of pagination is to split the results into manageable chunks and ensure it is as fast and accurate as possible, so the variation in the page size seems not relevant to that.
