# Ruby Test Environment

Ruby is tested with [`minitest`](https://github.com/minitest/minitest) through `rake` tasks. It also uses [
`rematch`](https://github.com/ddnexus/rematch) as a snapshot system.

## Prerequisite

- Install the gems: `bundle install`

### Rake tasks

Run `rake default` (or just `rake`).
